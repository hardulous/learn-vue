// Step-1. Define route component by importing them

// Step-2. Define routes and map them to a path
const routes = [
  // This '/' route can display both <Home/> and <SideBar/> component 
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "home",
    components: {
        default: Home,

    sensitive: true,   // Now path need to be case sensitive

  // Dynamic route
  {

    name: "postDetail",
    components: {
      default: PostDetail,
      postBar: PostBar
    } ,
    props: true   // Now the dynamic 'id' will be passed as props to the both component

  // 404 page for no match route
  {
    path: "/:pathMatch(.*)*",

  // Redirect route when user hit '/home' he will be redirected to '/' route
//   {
//     path: '/home',   // Actual path hit by user
//     redirect: '/'    // Redirected path 
//   },

  // An alias of '/' as '/ghar' and '/home' means when user visits /ghar or /home the URL remains the same but it will be matched as if the user is visiting the '/' route
//   {
//     path: '/',

  //   name: 'products',
  //   component: Product,
  //   props: true
  //  },

   // Repeatable Params
  //  {
  //   path: '/products/:prod+',   // This will match any no of path after /products/ like /products/one, /products/one/two etc. 
  //   name: 'product',
  //   component: Product,
  //   props: true
  //  },

   {

// Step-3. Creates a Router instance that can be used by our vue app.
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
});

// Step-4. Export the router instance for use
export default router;

/*

createWebHistory(string) also takes an argument which is the BASE URL of our application that tells vue-router what is the root path of our app ex :: 

createWebHistory('/my-app/') means:

Your app is served from a sub-directory like https://example.com/my-app/.

All internal routing will be prefixed with /my-app/

By-default the root path is '/' 

/:pathMatch(.*)* is a catch-all dynamic route used to match any path that doesn't match a defined route â€” often for displaying a "Page Not Found" (404) page

By-default in all of our route we have 'name' property assigned to each so all are Named Route. 

Here '/posts/:id' this path will execute for any value of :id like /posts/123 or /posts/abc which we dont want and we know id will always need to be number so have to use CUSTOM REGEX PATH. 

\\d+ (double backslash in JS to escape) = one or more digits can be there and must be number.

We can also have something like this '/posts/:id(\\d+)/category/:catName([a-z]+$)' the 'id' needs to be number only and 'catName' needs to be string only. 

You can also mark a parameter as optional by using the ? modifier like '/products/:productId?' it means it will match '/products' and '/products/12'. To further restrict productId to be number '/products/:productId(\\d+)?'

Sometime on same path we need to render different component for this again we use regex like '/products/:prod(\\d+)' or '/products/:prod'. The former will execute for 'prod' type number and other than that value the latter one will exeute. 

Vue Router evaluates routes in the order they are defined, but more specific routes (like those with regex constraints) take precedence over generic ones if both match. 

Sometime we need to match route with 'n' no of params in it for this we use 'REPEATABLE PARAMS' by '*' (0 or more) and '+' (1 or more)

By default, all routes are case-insensitive and match routes with or without a trailing slash ex, /about will match /About, /abouT/ and /about. This behavior can be configured with the strict and sensitive
